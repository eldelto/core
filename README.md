# Mono-repo for Personal Projects

This repository contains most of the things I'm currently working on plus a
bunch of helper libraries.

It contains the following somewhat finished projects:

## Blog

My personal blog that uses an Org-Mode file as CMS. Currently hosted at
[www.eldelto.net](https://www.eldelto.net).

Please see the project's [README](/cmd/blog/README.md) for more information.

## Plant Guild

A small website to help you in choosing beneficial neighbours for your next
planting project.

Please see the project's [README](/cmd/plantguild/README.md) for more information.
