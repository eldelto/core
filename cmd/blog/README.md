# Blog

My personal blog that uses an Org-Mode file as CMS. Currently hosted at
[www.eldelto.net](https://www.eldelto.net).

## About

Just a blog written in Go that I use to try out various web-dev-related things
and write the occasional opinion piece.

## TODO

- [ ] Setup rel-me auth
- [ ] Emit h-entry markup
- [ ] Revisit caching headers, especially `stale-while-revalidate`
- [ ] Rework parser
- [ ] Add compression middleware
