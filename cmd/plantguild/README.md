## About

Plant Guild is a project I built to help myself choose neighbouring plants that
benefit each other's growth.

The source code for this project can be found in this repository.

## How to use

Select a plant you want to grow and all good fitting neighbours will be
highlighted in green. Neutral plants are blue and incompatible ones are marked
red.

Of course this is just a guideline and you can do whatever you want ;)
