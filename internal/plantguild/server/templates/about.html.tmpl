    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Plant Guild is a project I built to help myself choose neighbouring
      plants that benefit each other's growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The source code for this project can be found on
      <a href="https://github.com/eldelto/core/tree/main/cmd/plantguild">Github</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <p>
      Select a plant you want to grow and all good fitting neighbours will be
      highlighted in green. Neutral plants are blue and incompatible ones are
      marked red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course this is just a guideline and you can do whatever you want ;)
