    - [ ] Test conditionals
    - [ ] Implement higher-level looping constructs
      - [ ] array ' func foreach
      - [ ] 10 ' func repeat
    - [ ] Think about implementing conditionals in terms of
	  'jmp' & 'cjmp' directly
    - [ ] Move most machine words from preamble to stdlib and
          make them immediate words

( How should the looping construct look like to be general enough but
  also avoid overflows and off-by-one-errors?

  Common cases:
  - Iterate over an array
  - Do n times
  - Do until something happened
  - Break out of the loop

  Can every looping construct be replaced with recursion?
  => Probably.

  Looping constructs could look like this:
  - array ' func foreach
  - 10 ' func repeat
  - Breaks are early function returns

  The disadvantage is, that every loop logic needs to be factored into
  its own word (for better or worse). Could also be a blessing to be
  honest. So might as well give it a try.
