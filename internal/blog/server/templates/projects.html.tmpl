<h1>Hobby Projects</h1>

Below you can find a list of most (at least the ones that are worth showing)
of my hobby projects.

<h2>Core</h2>
<p>
  Repository: <a href="https://github.com/eldelto/core" target="_blank">Github</a><br>
  Status: <strong>Permanently In Progress</strong>
</p>
<p>
  My newish mono-repo that contains all current projects. <strong>Doesn't
  contain all current projects yet :(</strong>
</p>

<h2>Project Ikaros</h2>
<p>
  Repository: <a href="https://github.com/eldelto/project-ikaros" target="_blank">Github</a><br>
  Status: <strong>In Progress</strong>
</p>
<p>
  My long-term project to build a custom flight-controller for a quad-copter
  from scratch (at least software-wise). It is based on a Raspberry Pi Pico W
  and contains the actual software for the micro controller, as well as a GUI
  application to monitor the sensor values.

<h2>Solvent</h2>
<p>
  Repository: <a href="https://github.com/eldelto/solvent" target="_blank">Github</a><br>
  Status: <strong>Rework Pending</strong>
</p>
<p>
  A CRDT-based to-do list written in Go with a React frontend. It doesn't
  support multiple users at the moment but I still regularly use a self-hosted
  instance with basic-auth for one-off to-do lists.
</p>
<p>
  The current syncing mechanism is based on regularly polling the backend which
  is already getting slow because the CRDT data structure is growing larger
  with every new edit. Therefore I plan to rework the project a bit as it is
  still the one project I use the most.

<h2>Temporary</h2>
<p>
  Repository: <a href="https://github.com/eldelto/temporary" target="_blank">Github</a><br>
  Status: <strong>Done</strong>
</p><p>
  A website for encrypted file-sharing written in Elixir and some vanilla
  Javascript. Uploaded files are automatically deleted after three days and the
  encryption happens on the client-side so you can safely share your darkest
  secrets.
</p>
<p> 
  The encryption algorithm is kinda basic as I'm not a big cryptographer
  but I once lost a password for an uploaded file and couldn't recover it even
  with full root access to the server so it is sufficient I guess.
</p>
<p>
  A publicly accessible version is hosted at
  <a href="https://temporary.eldelto.net" target="_blank">
    temporary.eldelto.com
  </a>
  .
